drawTikZtex
==========

A simple routine to get a standalone pdf from TikZ code.

Where I got the base from:
http://texblog.org/tag/pgftikz/#preview
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2701902/standalone-diagrams-with-tikz
The rest is self-explanatory:

- How to use (with example)
- What the input has to look like
- How to install
- No copyright



How to use (after installed, see bottom):
$ drawtikztex path/to/input.tex path2/too/output.pdf [png]

Example
$ drawtikztex drawing.tex drawing.pdf
converts the TikZ picture in drawing.tex into a pdf
$ drawtikztex drawing.tex drawing.pdf png
does the same as above, but additionally creates a png out of the pdf with default settings.

Once you have it as pdf use instructions from
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2701902/standalone-diagrams-with-tikz
$ pdftops -eps drawing.pdf
$ convert -density 300 drawing.eps drawing.png

input.tex contains only \begin{tikzpicture}...\end{tikzpicture}
Example content of a input.tex:
####################################################################
\begin{tikzpicture}[>=latex]
    \begin{scope}[xshift=0cm]
    \draw (2,0.1) rectangle (5,-0.15);
    \filldraw[fill=gray!20] (3.5,-0.15) rectangle (4.5,-0.25);
    \draw[->,very thick,double] (4,-1.5) -- (4,-0.75);
    \draw[thin,dashed] (4,-0.75) -- (4,0.5);
    \draw[<-,thick] (3.8,-0.3) -- (5.3,-1.5);
    \draw[->,thick] (3.7,-0.3) -- (2.2,-1.5);
    \end{scope}
\end{tikzpicture}
####################################################################

The program should be self explanatory: Look into drawtikz.sh.
Any further explanation is redundant.
Except:
You can modify the file drawtikz.tex to customize the output.
(For example if your TikZ drawing requires additional packages,
or you want a different border...)


How to install drawtikztex:
1) download the files contained in this folder
2) make the drawtikztex.sh into an executable:
    $ chmod +x drawtikztex.sh
3) put them in a folder of your choosing
    (except: it must be a folder with permission to make new folders)
    example: ~/.drawtikztex/
4) write this path in the file drawtikztex.sh:
    base=~/.drawtikztex
    (resp. now your chosen directory)
5) install by creating a symlink that is accessible from everywhere
    sudo ln -s ~/.drawtikztex/drawtikztex.sh /usr/local/bin/drawtikztex
